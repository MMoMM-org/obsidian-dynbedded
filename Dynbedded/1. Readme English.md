Sample Editor CommandHello,

welcome to the Test Vault of
```dynbedded
[[Dynbedded#GitHub Page]]
```
If you want to use this vault you will need to rename the following files with the correct date from TODAY!

- [[DP-2022-10-15]]
- [[2022-10-20 Not To be Found]]
- [[2022-10-20]]

And you need to rename the following files with the correct date of YESTERDAY!

- [[2022-10-19]]

>You can ofcourse also create additional notes and play around with your own custom date formats.

After renaming those notes you are free to proceed to 

- [[Example Standard]] showing you how normal [[Dynbedded]] works
- [[Example Date Substitution]] showing you how date substitution in [[Dynbedded]] works

If you want more information on how relative dates etc. work, take a look into [[date substitution]]
