## Pending Confirmation

### #13 — Refresh Interval Seconds can't be changed (Windows / Blue Topaz)
`Setting.setDisabled()` only toggles the `is-disabled` CSS class on the wrapper; it does not set the native HTML `disabled` attribute on the input. The Blue Topaz theme on Windows applies `pointer-events: none` aggressively under that class, blocking interaction with the field. Fixed by also calling `TextComponent.setDisabled()` on the text component itself, which sets `inputEl.disabled` (browser-enforced, theme-independent).

**Where:** `src/DynbeddedSettingTab.ts`

**Complexity: XS**

### Security & permissions cleanup
- Resolved 20 open Dependabot alerts (handlebars / undici / lodash / picomatch / flatted) by running `npm audit fix`. All were transitive devDependencies of the build/release tooling — `npm audit --omit=dev` was already 0. No runtime impact on the published plugin (`dependencies: {}`); only the lock file changed.
- Closed the open Code Scanning alert by adding an explicit `permissions:` block to `.github/workflows/release.yml`: workflow-default `contents: read`, with the release job elevated to `contents: write`, `issues: write`, and `pull-requests: write` for semantic-release.

**Where:** `package-lock.json`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`

**Complexity: XS**

## Technical Debt

### TD-6 — Auto-close issues and apply labels on release

Issues are currently closed manually after a release. Issue #9 was closed automatically because its commit contained `fixes #9` — the others only had `(#N)` in brackets, which GitHub doesn't recognise as a closing keyword.

Two things to fix:

1. **Commit convention:** Always use `closes #N` or `fixes #N` in commit messages (not just `(#N)`) so GitHub closes the issue automatically on merge to main.

2. **Released label:** Add a workflow step (or semantic-release plugin) that applies a `released` / `fixed` label to all issues closed by a release. Options:
   - [`semantic-release/github`](https://github.com/semantic-release/github) plugin already supports `successComment` and `releasedLabels` config — check if it's wired up in `.releaserc` or `package.json`
   - Alternatively, a small post-release GitHub Actions step using `gh issue edit --add-label released`

**Where:** `.github/workflows/release.yml`, commit message convention, optional `.releaserc`

**Complexity: XS–S**

## Future Features (P+1D)

### F-2 — Day name as relative date (`DWed`, `D-1Wed`)
Allow `{{DWed}}` to resolve to this week's Wednesday, and `{{D-1Wed}}` to last week's Wednesday.

**Syntax:** `{{[format]|D[±N][Mon|Tue|Wed|Thu|Fri|Sat|Sun]}}` or as standalone token.

**Implementation:** Pre-processing step in `getDynamicDate()` before moment.js formatting — detect pattern, compute date with `moment().day('Wednesday')` / `moment().subtract(N, 'week').day('Wednesday')`, substitute result.

**Complexity: Low**
